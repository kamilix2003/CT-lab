The Low Pass Filter passes low frequencies and blocks high frequencies.
It only allows low frequency signals from 0Hz to its cut-off frequency (fc) point to pass while blocking those any higher.  fc= 1 / 2×π×RL×CL 
Looking at the voltage gain vs frequency graph we are able to spot point where the characteristic " breaksdown" and starts going rapidly down.


frequency response resonant rlc circuit :
The response of course starts at zero, reaches a maximum value in the vicinity of the natural resonant frequency, and then drops again to zero as ω becomes infinite. 
On our  gain vs frequency graph we are able to notice the start of the characteristic taking place, before reaching a maximum value in the vicinity of the natural resonant frequency.

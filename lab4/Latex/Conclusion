Measuring frequency responses lets us analyze chosen circuits ( filters) in its frequency domain.
It also describes the steady-state response of a system to sinusoidal inputs of varying frequencies.
From the measurements of the amplitude ( ratio of voltages) and phase (in radians or degrees) of the output as a function of input frequency
we are able to do simpler analysis of  more complex systems like the filters in our laboratories.
The frequency response is closely related to the transfer function in linear systems, which is the Laplace transform of the impulse response.
Using plots graphs to draw characteristics of the quantities we have measured gives us a great way to look at frequency response.
Once a frequency response has been measured (e.g., as an impulse response), provided the system is linear and time-invariant, 
its characteristic can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a digital filter. Similarly, if a system
is demonstrated to have a poor frequency response, a digital or analog filter can be applied to the signals prior to their reproduction to compensate for these deficiencies.
